Marlin configuration files for skr 1.4 conversion

The list of things I've done includes: 
24v power supply,
x/Y and z axis dampers,
40w heater cartridges,
skr 1.4 main board (original touchscreen),
Nocta 12v fan for main board,
External bed MOSFET,
bed insulation,
Sunlu flexible (magnetic) bed surface,
Silicone bed spacers,
4010 blower fans for part(s) cooling fan.

Everything was downloaded and printed from
thingiverse. I may have missed some things
my memory is terrible. This is the first
time I've uploaded anything here, so don't
break out the pitch forks if something is
wrong please 🤣 I'm still working on a few things, 
but I haven't seen really any loss of quality
between 40mm/s and 140mm/s print speed. 
I am using the current version of cura, 
and I will upload the cura configurations 
as soon as I figure out how
